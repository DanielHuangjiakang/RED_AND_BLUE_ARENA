/**
 * The following enumerators represent global identifiers refering to graphic
 * assets. For example TEXTURE_ASSET_ID are the identifiers of each texture
 * currently supported by the system.
 *
 * So, instead of referring to a game asset directly, the game logic just
 * uses these enumerators and the RenderRequest struct to inform the renderer
 * how to structure the next draw command.
 *
 * There are 2 reasons for this:
 *
 * First, game assets such as textures and meshes are large and should not be
 * copied around as this wastes memory and runtime. Thus separating the data
 * from its representation makes the system faster.
 *
 * Second, it is good practice to decouple the game logic from the render logic.
 * Imagine, for example, changing from OpenGL to Vulkan, if the game logic
 * depends on OpenGL semantics it will be much harder to do the switch than if
 * the renderer encapsulates all asset data and the game logic is agnostic to it.
 *
 * The final value in each enumeration is both a way to keep track of how many
 * enums there are, and as a default value to represent uninitialized fields.
